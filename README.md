# Cadence Virtuoso – Digital Logic Circuits (GPDK045):
A curated collection of basic digital logic designs—spanning logic gates, combinational, and sequential circuits—designed, simulated, and analyzed using Cadence Virtuoso with the GPDK045 (45nm Generic CMOS Process Design Kit).

* Overview:
This repository showcases the schematic designs, symbol creation, layout views (for selected circuits), and transient simulations for core digital circuits developed in Cadence Virtuoso. All circuits are verified using transient analysis to confirm expected logical behavior.

* Circuits Implemented:
Logic Gates
•	AND (also includes layout + mini-project)
•	OR
•	NOT
•	NAND
•	XOR
•	NOR
•	XNOR
Combinational Circuits
•	Half Adder
•	Full Adder
•	Multiplexer (MUX)
•	Demultiplexer (DEMUX)
•	Encoder
•	Decoder
•	Half Subtractor
•	Full Subtractor
Sequential Circuits
•	SR Flip-Flop
•	JK Flip-Flop
•	D Flip-Flop

* Tools & Technologies:
•	EDA Tool: Cadence Virtuoso
•	PDK: GPDK045 (Generic 45nm CMOS)
•	OS: Linux (Red Hat)

* Simulation Approach
•	All designs were tested using transient analysis to validate their dynamic behavior.
•	Custom symbols were created for modular, hierarchical circuit design.
•	For selected circuits (like the AND gate), full layout design and verification were completed as a part of the mini-project.

* Mini Project Highlight – AND Gate
As part of the learning process, a complete mini project was developed around the AND gate, which includes:
•	Schematic design
•	Symbol creation
•	Transient simulation
•	Layout design
•	Design Rule Check (DRC) & Layout vs Schematic (LVS) validation
This project served as an introduction to the full front-to-back flow in digital IC design using Cadence tools.
